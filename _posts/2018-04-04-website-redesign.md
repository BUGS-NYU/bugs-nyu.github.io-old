We're proud to introduce a fresh, new look for the BUGS Open Source website. 

Club member [Rokney](https://github.com/Rantahu) took the lead in making open source contributions to our club's website. It was built and tested in the [test_site repository](https://github.com/BUGS-NYU/test_site)  and moved over to the [website repository](https://github.com/BUGS-NYU/bugs-nyu.github.io) once we had a fully functional build.

All projects in the club's GitHub hold open source licenses, so any member is welcome to make contributions to these projects if they feel like they have something to add or fix. That includes our club's website.

We hope you find the new redesign aesthetically and functionally pleasing.
