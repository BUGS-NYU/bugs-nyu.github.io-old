      <h2>Opportunities</h2>
      <p> Open source is a philosophy of sharing and transparency for the development of applications and projects, allowing for open inspection, modification, and enhancement. Anyone who uses the internet today is directly interacting with the products of
        open source initiatives, from Apache Web server to the entire operating system of Linux. </p>

    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h2>Plan</h2>
      <p> Our club will employ projects to teach skills and strategies that will be applicable to many fields, from computers to biology and chemistry. These projects may include a faculty member or outside expert from the respective field to further promote
        the usefulness of the skill being taught.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h2>Traction</h2>
      <p>The club has founding members in computer science and natural science majors within NYU. These members work with faculty members on open source applications within NYU labs from various fields. These applications within various fields can be taught
        and employed within the club. </p>
