          Open source represents a form of licensing that encourages collaboration
          and transparency. Although open source licenses may take a number of forms,
          essential features include being able to freely study, change,
          and distribute the source code. Look more on

          Other than maintaining open source projects such as Schedge, BUGS also 
          co-hosts project nights weekly on Friday. The event serves as a friendly 
          community for NYU students, specifically those majoring in Computer Science
          to exchange ideas, code and have fun. We are also experimenting with
          a mentorship program this summer, which helps students learn the basics
          of web development in React. The project can be found
