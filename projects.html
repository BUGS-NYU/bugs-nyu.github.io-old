			<p>This semester BUGS is collaborating with the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute near Albany, New York. BUGS is bringing one of their open source projects called YACS (Yet Another Course Scheduler) to NYU. Currently the NYU team is working on converting the Albert data to “YACS form”.  Along with that there is work to be done on frontend and backend so YACS can be adopted for NYU.</p>

			  <p>EJ and his team are recreating the classic 2D Soccer Physics game using Unity. In this game, players are controlled by a single button and the oly rule that applies is physics!</p>
			  <p>So far, EJ has taught his team the basics of Unity. Currently, EJ’s team is working together in smaller groups (Game play, UI, Player Control), to lay the foundation of the game. In the future, EJ hopes to customize the classic game with quirky features!</p>
