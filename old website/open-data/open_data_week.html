            <b>Abstract:</b> Using regression techniques, we forecasted historical stock data for companies in the S&P 500. To accomplish this task, we fetched data from the early 2000s to 2015 using data supported by pandas's internal data reader for google finance. Then, we forecasted stock prices for 2015-2018 and compared these prices with actual stock prices for this period in order to test the accuracy of our model.  <br>

            <b>Abstract:</b>
            Play is an important context through which children learn about themselves and their environment. Previous research has used various construction toys to examine the development of infants and young children’s spatial, cognitive, and social skills, without considering the motor and perceptual skill level necessary to complete the tasks. The present study examines the perceptual and manual actions that contribute to children’s performance while playing with a construction toy in real time, and across development. 
            Data collection is still ongoing, but so far we have presented 56 children (12 to 60 months of age) and 19 adults with Squigz, a toy made of colorful, flexible, silicone designed for creative 3D construction. Each Squigz piece has suction cups at one or both ends, capable of sticking to a non-porous surface, or to each other. Squigz are a salient model for perceptual and manual exploration. The satisfying popping noise when Squigz are pulled apart leads children to persist in exploring the toy, while the Squigz pieces are the perfect size for manipulation by the participants’ small hands. Children perform a variety of exploratory actions with the Squigz (mouthing, fingering/bending the cups, banging, rolling), but only the designed action of applying pressure with the suction cup facing the tabletop or the suction cup of another piece will allow children to build complex, 3- dimensional structures. 
            We use behavioral video coding to investigate the temporal relations among exploratory actions, discovery of the designed action, persistence in implementing the designed action, and creative construction. Preliminary analyses show that the youngest children enthusiastically explored the Squigz in non-designed ways such as mouthing the pieces. Between 18 and 30 months of age, children began by arranging and stacking Squigz pieces. Most eventually stumbled on the designed action by banging the Squigz against the table or two Squigz against each other so that they stuck, but rarely did both. Between 36 and 48 months, children discovered the designed action faster in real time, but still perseverated with sticking pieces to table or building a chain of Squigz. Finally, by 54 months children exploited the Squigz for 3-dimensional, creative construction, building structures more complex than a chain. Adults immediately created complex, 3-dimensional structures. The uniquely compelling properties of Squigz encouraged exploration of various actions—even in the youngest infants—and often led to inadvertent discovery of the designed action. These findings illustrate the importance of viewing development with the knowledge that multiple systems develop in tandem, and not in a vacuum. Future studies examining spatial, cognitive, or social development should take into consideration whether the tasks used are representative of the target age group’s abilities.

            <b>Abstract:</b>
            Introduction.
            Growing up in a working-class community where drugs offered comfort to many, I witnessed relatives and friends struggle with drug addiction, some until it killed them. By the time I turned 21, my uncle had died of Hepatitis C, contracted through needle sharing, and three of my friends had fatally overdosed on opiates. These losses forced me to confront the complexity of pharmacology at an early age—that drugs designed to maximize health can result in the opposite.

            We as clinicians, data scientists, and community members need to assume some responsibility for moving the field in a direction where clinicians are better trained to prevent and recognize drug abuse, and drug death, especially when working in resource-strapped communities.

            Data Storytelling.
            This project uses multiple government open data sets to: First, provide a snapshot of current US state trends in opioid overdose death rates. Second, I employ machine learning methods on the Connecticut Open Access Dataset called Accidental Drug Related Deaths 2012-June 2017. Third, I provide some preliminary analysis in trying to detect overprescribing of opioids using an Open Access Centers for Medicaid and Medicare dataset.

            The Drug Related Deaths dataset contains the following variables: Date of drug-related death, Race, Age, Sex, Residence City, Death City, Injury Location, Death Location (Latitude/Longitude Coordinates), Officer Notes, Heroin, Fentanyl, Cocaine, and additional drugs.

            This project combines data visualization and machine learning, identifies alarming trends in accidental drug deaths, illustrates who is at risk, depicts the proportion of Naloxone prescribing pharmacies to opioid deaths, and more. Descriptive analysis reveal that the two youngest deaths, each at age 14, and the oldest death was at age 87 were related to opioid use: heroin, fentanyl, and oxycodone, respectively. Interestingly, counts of drug-related deaths were significantly higher during the months of October and November. The appearance of oxycodone in drug-related deaths decreased since 2012, while all other drugs in the dataset increased. Fentanyl-related deaths have risen exponentially, but heroin-related deaths still remain the most frequent drug-related death in CT.

            Machine Learning Methods and Outcomes.
            The dataset was split into a 70% training set and 30% test set. Statistical analysis, data visualization, feature engineering, and machine learning methods were performed using the open source programming language called R. Boruta method was used in determining which features to be kept in predicting a heroin death vs a non-heroin drug death. Three tree-based and rule-based models were designed and trained over 10-fold cross validation and evaluated by AUC, ROC, sensitivity, and specificity. The C50 model tuned with grid expansion performed the best with an AUC of 0.9972. The Stochastic Gradient Boosting model came in second with an AUC of 0.9947, and the Rpart Classification Tree model had an AUC of 0.9428.

            The outcomes of this project show that we can accurately predict type of death. However, a human-centered approach is necessary in prompting action and collaborations among diverse fields are crucial in employing technology to overcome some of addiction’s biggest challenges.

            <b>Abstract:</b>
            This project investigates YouTube videos' attributes to predict whether a given trending video will be viral or not. It is important to note that they are not necessarily the most-viewed videos. It's an ongoing project but I would like to highlight one discovery. 

            The probability density curve described here (goo.gl/b58chN) highlights counts of days between trending and published by countries. It is interesting how most viral videos from France and Germany take 1 day to go from published to viral but the event of any number of days it takes to go from published to viral is equally likely for videos from USA and UK. It is not intuitive at all that there can be such polarity for information that is simply travelling online. My conjecture is that it takes fewer days for Youtube videos to go from published to viral if it's originated from countries with homogeneous culture and less diversity such as France Germany versus USA and UK. There is definitely more work needed to be done but I am very excited to be able to tell a story with such complex data.

            <b>Abstract:</b>
            A cornerstone of NYC restaurants are the sanitary inspection grades – generally, the higher the better (although some friends swear by tiny restaurants with C ratings as their favorites). As consumers of such restaurants (sometimes including C-rated restaurants) I was curious to know what exactly differs between A-rated restaurants and C-rated restaurants with respect to hygiene, violations, and more. In this analysis, I discovered insights about how likely a restaurant is to transition between sanitation grades, how graders may be a bit biased in their evaluation, and what restaurants I'll be avoiding in the future.

            <b>Abstract:</b>
            Everyday movements occur in the context of changing body-environment-task relations. Given the flux of everyday activity, often habitual behaviors must be inhibited and replaced with more appropriate alternatives. Such behavioral flexibility reflects the remarkable ability to adjust motor solutions to the changing constraints of body, environment and task. Flexible, purposeful behaviors require planning. For example, people of all ages normally reach for the handle of a hammer with an overhand radial grip. But when the handle points away from their dominant hand, they must use a non-habitual underhand grip to ensure the desired final position of the tool. In contrast to adults, young children frequently select a habitual overhand grip. As a consequence, their hand is in an awkward position when they use the tool. My work examines the source of children’s errors when grasping the handle of a tool. To this end, we innovated a novel method for obtaining electroencephalography (EEG), head-mounted eye tracking, motion tracking, and video simultaneously on the same children on each of 80 trials grasping a hammer. We collected data from 3- to 5-year-olds (N = 15) and adults (N = 21). Children differ in terms of where they direct their visual attention when the direction of the handle is revealed, their neural processing (“readiness potential”), and the straightness of their hand path as they initiate the reach. In other words, motor planning goes awry from the first glimpse of the tool, and errors propagate through the system. This work highlights the role of planning in developmental changes in flexibility. Planning solves the problem of where, when and how to perform before acting. Most important, planning unfolds from moment to moment in a real-time perception-action cascade, starting with gathering environmental cues, followed by extracting task-relevant information, and finally formulating a movement strategy. Our work shows that failure to perform earlier actions impedes performance of later ones. Successful planning cascades entail gazing at the relevant locations, neural processing that accommodates to the environment, and smooth motion toward the goal. Without all these components, movement is limited to habitual, non-flexible activity.

            <b>Abstract:</b>
            The primary objective of the project is to derive
            statistical techniques for analyzing data typically collected
            in fire departments. As improved resource allocation and
            statistical analysis of emergency medical calls can
            determine the impact of providing another paramedic unit
            in the field. The other goal of the project is to visualize
            incidents in an area and find the most efficient position for
            future fire stations.

            <b>Abstract:</b>
                 Vehicle collisions have been on an increasing trend in the last decade. Nearly 1.3 million people die in vehicle collisions each year, on average 3,287 deaths a day with an additional 20-50 million are injured or disabled. Currently, road crashes are ranked as the ninth most serious cause of death in the world, and without new initiatives to improve road safety, fatal crashes will likely rise to the third place by the year 2020.
                 Vehicle collisions not only cause monetary losses and place great physical and emotional burden on victims involved, they also pose huge threat on public safety. Unless action is taken, vehicle collision injuries are predicted to become the fifth leading cause of death by 2030. As a result, traffic safety management has emerged as a topic of discussion for researchers all over the world. In this project, we will focus on vehicle collisions in New York city and predict the most likely contributing factors of a collision if it happened in Manhattan using features extracted from the vehicle’s current location in real time.
                 One potential use of the model is to integrate it into a navigation app, such as Google Map or Waze. When a driver is following the navigation and driving to his destination, the navigation app can make real time prediction on the most likely contributing factors of a collision if it happened given the current time, driver’s location, weather, vehicle type etc. In this way, the driver can get real time notifications that will remind him to take special care of certain driving behaviors when he is driving in a given set of conditions. 
                 The other potential use is to apply it into the Connected Vehicle (CV) environment. The Connected Vehicle Pilot Deployment Program (CVPD) is an ongoing program funded by the US Department of Transportation (DOT) and NYC is one of the three pilot test locations, which focus on tackling congested urban traffic environment. In the CV environment, a driver will be alarmed if a message related to unsafe traffic condition has been received by its vehicle. So, our model have the potential to improve the current CV driver warning system or be an supplement of the current CV environment.
