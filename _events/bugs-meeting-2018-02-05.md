We will be having our first general meeting next Monday, February 5 in Courant room 512 at 7pm.

The event will be a meet and greet where you'll be introduced to the continuing projects and the plan for the semester. There will be pizza as well.
Around 8pm, after the meet and greet, interested members are welcome to stay for a GitHub workshop on the basics they may find useful for contribution to our projects.

We know there are some members that want to learn how to use Git through the command line. We'll be having a workshop for that a couple weeks after this first event.

In collaboration with New York City's Open Data Week, we're planning an Open Data event for later this semester.
