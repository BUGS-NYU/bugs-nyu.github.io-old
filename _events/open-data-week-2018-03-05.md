# NYC Open Data Week @ NYU
## Hosted by [BUGS Open Source Club](https://bugs-nyu.github.io/)

--------------------------------------------------------------

The goal of this event is to engage the different campuses, schools and
departments of the NYU community in a discussion about the topics of NYC
Open Data and open data in general. Many courses, research groups and
other organizations use open data. We want to see what these different
groups are doing and to open avenues for collaborations.

**Abstract:** Using regression techniques, we forecasted historical stock data for companies in the S&P 500. To accomplish this task, we
fetched data from the early 2000s to 2015 using data supported by pandas's internal data reader for google finance. Then, we forecasted
stock prices for 2015-2018 and compared these prices with actual stock prices for this period in order to test the accuracy of our model.

**Abstract:** The present study examines the perceptual and manual actions that contribute to children’s performance while playing with a
construction toy in real time, and across development. Data collection is still ongoing, but so far we have presented 56 children (12 to 60
months of age) and 19 adults with Squigz, a toy made of colorful, flexible, silicone designed for creative 3D construction. Each Squigz piece has suction cups at one or both ends, capable of sticking to a non-porous surface, or to each other. Squigz are a salient model for perceptual and manual exploration. The satisfying popping noise when Squigz are pulled apart leads children to persist in exploring the toy,
while the Squigz pieces are the perfect size for manipulation by the participants’ small hands. Children perform a variety of exploratory
actions with the Squigz (mouthing, fingering/bending the cups, banging, rolling), but only the designed action of applying pressure with the
suction cup facing the tabletop or the suction cup of another piece will allow children to build complex, 3- dimensional structures. We use
behavioral video coding to investigate the temporal relations among exploratory actions, discovery of the designed action, persistence in
implementing the designed action, and creative construction. The findings illustrate the importance of viewing development with the knowledge that multiple systems develop in tandem, and not in a vacuum. Future studies examining spatial, cognitive, or social development should take into consideration whether the tasks used are representative of the target age group’s abilities.

**Abstract:** I aim to build a predictive model for bitcoin price which uses everyday news that affects the market using Natural Language
Processing and not only historical price data.

**Abstract:** This project uses multiple government open data sets to: First, provide a snapshot of current US state trends in opioid overdose
death rates. Second, I employ machine learning methods on the Connecticut Open Access Dataset called Accidental Drug Related Deaths 2012-June 2017. Third, I provide some preliminary analysis in trying to detect overprescribing of opioids using an Open Access Centers for Medicaid and Medicare dataset. This project combines data visualization and machine learning, identifies alarming trends in accidental drug deaths, illustrates who is at risk, depicts the proportion of Naloxone prescribing pharmacies to opioid deaths, and more. Descriptive analysis reveal that the two youngest deaths, each at age 14, and the oldest death was at age 87 were related to opioid use: heroin, fentanyl, and oxycodone, respectively. The outcomes of this project show that we can accurately predict type of death. However, a human-centered approach is necessary in prompting action and collaborations among diverse fields are crucial in employing technology to overcome some of addiction’s biggest challenges.

**Abstract:** This project investigates YouTube videos' attributes to predict whether a given trending video will be viral or not. It is important to note that they are not necessarily the most-viewed videos. It's an ongoing project but I would like to highlight one discovery. The probability density curve described here (goo.gl/b58chN) highlights counts of days between trending and published by countries. It is interesting how most viral videos from France and Germany take 1 day to go from published to viral but the event of any number of days it takes to go from published to viral is equally likely for videos from USA and UK. It is not intuitive at all that there can be such polarity for information that is simply travelling online. My conjecture is that it takes fewer days for Youtube videos to go from published to viral if it's originated from countries with homogeneous culture and less diversity such as France Germany versus USA and UK. There is definitely more work needed to be done but I am very excited to be able to tell a story with such complex data.

**Abstract:** A cornerstone of NYC restaurants are the sanitary inspection grades – generally, the higher the better (although some friends swear by tiny restaurants with C ratings as their favorites). As consumers of such restaurants (sometimes including C-rated restaurants) I was curious to know what exactly differs between A-rated restaurants and C-rated restaurants with respect to hygiene, violations, and more. In this analysis, I discovered insights about how likely a restaurant is to transition between sanitation grades, how graders may be a bit biased in their evaluation, and what restaurants I'll be avoiding in the future.

**Abstract:** Everyday movements occur in the context of changing body-environment-task relations. My work examines the source of children’s errors when grasping the handle of a tool. To this end, we innovated a novel method for obtaining electroencephalography (EEG), head-mounted eye tracking, motion tracking, and video simultaneously on the same children on each of 80 trials grasping a hammer. We collected data from 3- to 5-year-olds (N = 15) and adults (N = 21). Children differ in terms of where they direct their visual attention when the direction of the handle is revealed, their neural processing (“readiness potential”), and the straightness of their hand path as they initiate the reach. In other words, motor planning goes awry from the first glimpse of the tool, and errors propagate through the system. Our work shows that failure to perform earlier actions impedes performance of later ones. Successful planning cascades entail gazing at the relevant locations, neural processing that accommodates to the environment, and smooth motion toward the goal. Without all these components, movement is limited to habitual, non-flexible activity.

**Abstract:** The primary objective of the project is to derive statistical techniques for analyzing data typically collected in fire departments. As improved resource allocation and statistical analysis of emergency medical calls can determine the impact of providing another
paramedic unit in the field. The other goal of the project is to visualize incidents in an area and find the most efficient position for
future fire stations.

**Abstract:** In this project, we will focus on vehicle collisions in New York city and predict the most likely contributing factors of a collision if it happened in Manhattan using features extracted from the vehicle’s current location in real time. One potential use of the model is to integrate it into a navigation app, such as Google Map or Waze. When a driver is following the navigation and driving to his destination, the navigation app can make real time prediction on the most likely contributing factors of a collision if it happened given the current time, driver’s location, weather, vehicle type etc. In this way, the driver can get real time notifications that will remind him to take special care of certain driving behaviors when he is driving in a given set of conditions.
