Jiayue (Joanna) Zhang is a Junior majoring in Mathematics and Computer Science in CAS. Intellectual challenges of her school work bring her either joy or existential crises; in most cases math the latter and CS the former. One thing she loves about NYC is that performances of her favorite artists are usually only a subway ride away from school. Her guilty pleasure is taking mahjong breaks at Bobst.
